Technologies and Techniques Used
This backend project is built with the following technologies and tools:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications.
Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to create the RESTful API and handle routing.
MongoDB: NoSQL document database for storing application data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for schema definition, validation, and database interaction.
Validator: Library for string validation and sanitization, used to validate user input (e.g., URLs).
Nodemon: Utility that automatically restarts the server during development when file changes are detected.
ESLint: Linter for identifying and fixing code quality and style issues.
Prettier: Code formatter to ensure consistent code style.
Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide: Enforced via ESLint for best practices and code consistency.
Techniques
RESTful API Design: Follows REST principles for resource-based routing and HTTP status codes.
Error Handling: Centralized and consistent error handling for validation, database, and server errors.
Data Validation: Uses Mongoose schema validation and the validator library to ensure data integrity.
Modular Structure: Organized codebase with separate folders for controllers, models, routes, and utilities.
Environment Variables: (If used) For configuration and sensitive data management.
